Assignment 2 Report

1) Run Data

As requested by the assignment, we conducted three runs for each of the two 
possible variations, using the system time command and the 1408.in matrix
for both input matrices. Below are the runtimes for each variation. We decided 
to use the "real" value given by the time command. 

          |  Run 1    |  Run 2    |  Run 3    |  Average     |
----------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
Float     |   3.017s  |   2.994s  |   2.935s  |   2.982s     |
Double    |   3.052s  |   3.035s  |   3.013s  |   3.033s     |

As expected, the float version was slightly faster than the double version.


2) Question: In your kernel implementation, how many threads can be
simultaneously executing on a GeForce 980 GPU, which contains 16 Streaming
Multiprocessors. Use nvcc --ptxas-options="-v" <yourfile>.cu to see the
resource usage of your kernel.
