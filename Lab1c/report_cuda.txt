CGMA is the ratio between Global memory access and floating point operations

2 Global accesses transferring memory from global to shared
2*32(TILEWDITH) floating operations, one multiplication and one addition
Therefore CGMA 64/2=32

In part B, there were two global acesses and two floating operations, therefore the CGMA was 2

Part C has a significantly improved CGMA, 32 times better.
