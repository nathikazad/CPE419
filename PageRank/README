How to Build:

Typing “make” will build both programs. 
Typing “make clean” will remove all object files and executables.

How to Run:

python pagerank.py file_name version [-w]

file_name: name of input file (file does not need to be in the current working directory)

version: three possible values
phi -> runs only Xeon Phi version
cuda -> runs only Cuda version
both -> runs both versions sequentially (Xeon Phi first, Cuda second)

-w : Flag for the NCAA-Football dataset. This flag is used to determine which team won and therefore, 
what team the arrow between the two teams points to. MAKE SURE TO PUT -w AS THE LAST COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT IF NEEDED.

Program Notes:

We were able to successfully run the Live Journal dataset and get a significant speedup with both parallel 
implementations. However, the results in the overall performance summary above and in the detailed results 
below were gathered using different values of ‘d’ and ‘vector difference’ than those required to be considered for extra credit.
